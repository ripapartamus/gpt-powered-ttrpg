To run this, you will need your own ChatGPT API key. I will not give you mine.

Create a file called `credentials.py` with the following format:

`GPT_KEY = 'your-gpt-key-here'`

To see an example of how to run everything (that I've put together so far), run the `Running everything so far.ipynb` 
notebook in Jupyter or whatever you want.
